    ///    Create a GameObject or reuse an existing one\n
    ///    add this script to the GameObject\n

    /// A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that focuses on the essentials of the Maestro API functionality. 
    /// This script demonstrates only a few basic functions to help users get started with the API.
    /// - Error handling is minimal, the user interface is basic, and manipulations in Unity are minimized.
    /// - Prefabs like `MidiFilePlayer` and `MidiStreamPlayer` are essential components of Maestro. 
    ///   While this demo creates these prefabs via script, it is recommended to add them in the Unity editor 
    ///   for real projects to take full advantage of the Inspector's parameters.
