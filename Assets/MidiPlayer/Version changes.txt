Please, read this before updating:
   - Backup your own project
   - If you get errors after updating, please quit Unity Editor and reload your project (GUID must be updated).
   - If you are updating from an older version and errors persist, delete the MidiPlayer folder from your project and reinstall Maestro.

Maestro MPTK attained the age of maturity. This new version is mainly focused on consistency and simplification.
I hope you will appreciate it!

Thank for your comments and talks, that help a lot to make Maestro better.
